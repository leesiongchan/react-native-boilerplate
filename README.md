# React Native Boilerplate

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [react-native-unimodules](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) + [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) + [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) + [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) + [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) + [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver)

**Remember to replace all the `reactnativeboilerplate` to your project name.**
**There is a problem with the latest version of [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/issues/805) and I have added a patch, please remove it once the new version has fixed it**
